# Data Science Pro Degree (Python Projects)

## Overview

This repository contains the python projects that I done during my Data Science Pro Degree Training Course at iMarticus, India. The [dataset folder](https://github.com/D-Satyajit/iMarticus-Projects/tree/master/Datasets) is having train and test datasets of Credit Risk and Bank Loan data. Following is the list of projects in Jupyter Notebook :

- Â [Project-I Loss Estimation of Car Loan using Linear Regression](https://github.com/D-Satyajit/iMarticus-Projects/blob/master/Project-I%20Loss%20Estimation%20using%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
-  [Project-II Credit Risk using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/D-Satyajit/iMarticus-Projects/blob/master/Python%20Project-I%20Credit%20Risk%20using%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
-  [Project-III Credit Risk using SVM](https://github.com/D-Satyajit/iMarticus-Projects/blob/master/Python%20Project-II%20Credit%20Risk%20using%20SVM.ipynb)

All the projects were done from scratch, that involves data cleaning, statistical analysis, business intelligence, visualizing, modeling, validating and predicting. 

## Problem Definition

**Loss estimation prediction of Bank:** The challenge is to predict the likelihood of approval status of the loan, based on the customer detail provided while applying for a loan.

**Credit Risk Case Study:** Involves automating the possibility of whether a person will pay back the loan or not. Prediction is done based on the two significant variable out of various other variable such as income, education, loan amount,credit score, etc. of the applicant.
